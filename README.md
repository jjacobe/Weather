# Weather App

# Overview

In this project, I created a web app that would tell the user the weather in different cities around world using Python Django and API. This web app would allow the user to view different cities weather on the main site but gave them the option to customize by adding and removing different weather locations to how the user would want it designed. The result would give you the name of the city location, the weather measured in Fahrenheit and a brief description of the forecast. 

Running the following command:

- python manage.py runserver

This would start up the test server on your local computer to run the site and the first site you would see would be the main weather app. The addditional page is just an about page of the app and how it works. 

The purpose of this software was to provide a way for anyone accurate weather report of different cities across the world. This web app is user friendly and is simple to understand for all ages. This is aimed for those that are checking the weather whether locally or in other cities at different destinations.


# Web Pages

The main weather page is a where the user would mainly spend their time on, which is to find the different city weathers available. You can add and remove different locations and customize it the way you would want it. 

The about page briefly goes over the web app and how to use the app.
